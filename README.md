# Ecology2048-App

This work was part of the Ecology course of Semester 3.

This is a 2048 based Ecology game with the theme of pollution. The gameplay is similar to the 2048 game but the only difference is that instead of '2's, we get the basic unit of waste initially.
That basic waste builds up to different harmful wastes when joined together.

There are three different levels each with increasing difficulty. The gameplay and the the different levels are shown in this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10-pLI3MB6TUH4bi0g7XZm8WgIaCi7-wy/view?usp=sharing).
The video also has the demonstration of the other game made by other team members but this 2048 game was built by me and Mathew. 

Mathew wrote the basic terminal based java code for the game. I modified it according to the needs of the Android Studio. I also made the basic simple layout of the App.

##How to play
If you have Android Studio installed, you can directly run the App from there and make changes as you like it. 

If you want to download the apk file and play on your mobile, go to AppWork -> app -> build -> outputs -> apk -> debug and download the apk file. 

## Main files
The Java code files are present in AppWork -> app -> src -> main -> java -> com -> example -> ecology2048

The images are located in AppWork -> app -> src -> main -> res -> drawable

The xml files are located in AppWork -> app -> src -> main -> res -> layout
